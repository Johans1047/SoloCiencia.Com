College Project - Dynamic Website with JSP
This repository contains a college project aimed at developing a dynamic website using JavaServer Pages (JSP) as the backend technology. The project focuses on creating a website that can handle dynamic content and interact with a database.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a dynamic website that utilizes JSP for the backend functionality. JSP is a Java-based technology that allows the mixing of HTML, XML, and Java code to create dynamic web pages.

Features
The website built for this project will include the following features:

Dynamic Content: The website will be capable of generating dynamic content based on user input or database queries. This allows for a personalized and interactive user experience.

Database Interaction: The website will interact with a database to store and retrieve data. This could include user profiles, product information, or any other relevant data for the website's purpose.

User Authentication: The project will incorporate user authentication to provide secure access to certain features or sections of the website. Users will be able to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

Frontend Design: The project will focus on creating an appealing and user-friendly frontend design using HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript. The design will be responsive and compatible with different devices and screen sizes.

MVC Architecture: The website's codebase will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating the concerns of data handling, user interface, and application logic. This ensures a more modular and maintainable codebase.

Setup and Deployment
To set up and deploy the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the project as a ZIP file.

Install a Java Development Kit (JDK) if you don't have one installed already. Ensure that the JDK version is compatible with the project requirements.

Set up a web server or a local development environment such as Apache Tomcat or Eclipse IDE with the necessary configurations to run JSP files.

Create a database and configure the project to connect to it. Update the necessary credentials and connection settings in the project files.

Import the project into your preferred IDE or text editor to make any required modifications or customizations.

Deploy the project to your local or remote web server, ensuring that all dependencies and configurations are properly set up.

Access the website through a web browser by entering the appropriate URL or localhost address, depending on your setup.
